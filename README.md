# McCoders 
Introducing the McCoder's Cookbook, an upcoming digital culinary project by the McCoders group. 
As we embark on our second bootcamp challenge, we're excited to blend the foundational elements of web development: 
HTML, CSS, and a pinch of Vanilla JavaScript DOM manipulation. Stay tuned as the McCode group takes you on a coding journey, 
where we'll be serving up a digital cookbook that's as engaging as it is informative!
